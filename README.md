Installation
-------------------------
To install with Composer and Packagist:  
`"ernb14/cflash": "dev-master"`

How to use flash messages
-------------------------

Firs you need to add this shared service in to your page controller.

`$di->setShared('flash', function() use ($di) { 
    $flashmessage = new \CFlash\CFlash\CFlash(); 
    $flashmessage->setDI($di); 
    return $flashmessage; 
});`

Then you need to copy the images and css file in to your img and css paths. So you need to go to your theme root path like this:  
`cd your-theme`  
`cp vendor/ernb14/CFlash/src/CFlash/css/CFlash.css webroot/css`  
`cp -r vendor/ernb14/CFlash/src/CFlash/img/flash webroot/img`  

Now you only have to put this out in a route: 
Example message `$app->flash->CustomMessage('GodkÃ¤nt', 'success'); ` and to display the message use `$messages = $app->flash->displayFlashMessages();` and `$app->views->addString($messages);`  to retrive the messages.

Pre defined messages
-------------------------
This class includes five pre defined messages. And those are 'error', 'success', 'info', 'warning', 'notice'. Here is and example of how you can use one: `$app->flash->CustomMessage('Felmeddelenade', 'error');`   

To create a new message you can do this `$app->flash->CustomMessage('Your message', 'message type');` which the type defines the css class that you can modify.
